# Frejm
Another PHP Framework??

FREJM
Have you ever worked with a MVC framework such as Laravel or Symphony and said: "I wish this was a MC framework made by a single junior developer...". You haven't? Weirdo.
Well I'd like to introduce you to Frejm it's an MC(Model Controller) framework for people that really wanna suffer while programming web apps.
It is also basically a stripped and much much worse version of Laravel.
We could talk about all the features it has, but I think it's better to talk about all the features that it doesn't have(in no particular order):
  - A documentation
  - Facade classes
  - Full middleware support
  - Terminable middleware
  - Group Routing
  - Route model binding
  - Name routes
  - Any kind of security whatsoever
  - Resource Controllers
  - VIEWS??? But who needs those anyways
  - Any support for outside packages
  - Composer support
  - Validation
  - Any kind of error or exception handling
  - and since the list is getting pretty long : Broadcasting, Contracts, Events, Mail, Localization, Rate Limiting
  - and so on...
  
On a more serious note: 
    This is a stripped Laravel copy framework made as a personal project. It is not intented for use by anyone.
